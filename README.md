# File-Structures
Mini-Project about File Compression Using LZW Algorithm.

# ABSTRACT

File compression is enabled through a file or data compression software that creates a compressed version of each processed file. Typically, file compression works by scanning an entire file, identifying similar or repetitive data and patterns and replacing duplicates with a unique identifier. This identifier is usually much smaller in size than the original word and consumes less space. Thus, the size of the compressed file is considerably smaller.

The  File Compression is the data Compression Method in which the logical size of the file is reduced to Save disk Space For easier and Faster Transmission Over a Network. It Enables the Creation of a one or more files the Same data at a Size Substantially Smaller than Orginal file.

File Compression Method Using LZW(Lempel-Ziv-Welch) Algorithm.
This Algorithm is Typically used In GIF and Optionally in POF and TIFF.
LZW Compression Works by Reading a Sequence of Symbols into Strings  and Converting Strings into Codes.Because the Codes take up Less Space than the Strings they Replace We Get Compression.

The File Compression Typically Works  by Finding Similar  Strings within a File and Replacing Those Strings with a Temporary Binary Representation to make overall Filesize Smaller.

This project has been created using Eclipse, with the platform WINDOWS. The project title-“Text File Compression” talks about how we Compress the Given File and data accepted from the Editor and also use it to retrieve Information. 

# INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODES
1)Clone or download the zip file.

2)Unzip the downloaded file.

3)open the folder and open the code in any of your preferred editor or an IDE.

4)Save the code and run the code.

5)It will Open UI Containing Two Buttons Compression and Decompreesion Choose the Options in which You want to Perform the Operations.

6)You will be displayed with the menu choice of various options.The operations act upon the record file.

7)Choose the option of your choice to be executed.

8)Check the lzw files which are generated in the respective folder after execution.
